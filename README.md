# Machine Learning Technican

Completed training from [amii.ca](https://amii.ca)

/Capstone is our final project
/Colab is the lessons and practice assignments



Continuing my understanding of how the human mind and brain work, completed this science-based approach to applying machine learning (ML) by identifying the scope and aligning with business goals, including determining where ML solutions can be effectively applied.

* Data Collection, Preprocessing, Exploration, Visualization, Transformers, Feature Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis to reveal trends, insights, and feature correlations. 
* Models included k-NN, decision trees, regression and pipelines for model comparison
* Implemented hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch) to decrease the complexity of the model while improving performance metrics
* Capstone project presented findings and prediction model to enhance business valueContinuing my understanding of how the human mind and brain work, completed this science-based approach to applying machine learning (ML) by identifying the scope and aligning with business goals, including determining where ML solutions can be effectively applied.
